## AutoTests
This is a script which automatically checks the tests for the given exercise.
It should be dumb proof so if you encounter any errors or miscoding do not hesitate in wiring me through mail or discord
In order to install it:  
git clone https://github.com/IvanDezaD/AutoTestsForAdsis.git  
cd AutoTestsForAdsis  
chmod +x *  
./install.sh <path-to-tests-folder>   
Now in order to view the help menu run (in tests folder):  
./AutoTest.sh -h  
That should be it
